# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Ensemble Methods and Neural Networks

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning solution for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using ensemble methods and neural networks. The system utilizes various advanced machine learning techniques to identify potentially fraudulent activities in credit card transactions.

## Project Structure

-   `credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation and analysis
-   `confusion_matrix_SMOTE.png`: Visualization of the model's performance using confusion matrix after SMOTE

## Features

-   Implementation of multiple machine learning models
-   SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for handling imbalanced data
-   Ensemble methods for improved prediction accuracy
-   Neural Network implementation for complex pattern recognition
-   Detailed performance analysis and visualization
